Connect Four is a game for two players to take turns trying to get 4 checkers of their color in a row while preventing their opponent doing the same.


How to Play:
Drop one checker at a time into an open space on the board.  The goal is to line up 4 of your checkers before your opponent has the chance to do just that.

Technologies used:
I built this version of Connect Four using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library.
